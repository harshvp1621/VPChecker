LLVM Comparision

This claim is discussed in Section 7.4.1 of the paper under “VPChecker Accuracy”
and illustrated in Table 1. This directory includes all scripts required to
reproduce Table 1.

We recommend using the Jupyter notebook in the llvm_analysis directory to generate
the contents of the table.

Before you begin, ensure the Python virtual environment is installed and activated.

To open the Jupyter notebook:
```
$ cd llvm_analysis
$ conda activate supply_chain_py311
$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=6868

# In the terminal output, click the access-token URL to open Jupyter in your browser.
```

To run on public infrastructure like Google Colab upload the llvm_analysis
folder and import the LLVM_Analysis.ipynb notebook.
