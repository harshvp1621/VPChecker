CVE Exposure Analysis

This claim is discussed in Section 7.3 of the paper under “CVE Exposure Analysis”
and illustrated in Figure 6. This directory includes all scripts required to
reproduce Figure 6.

We recommend using the Jupyter notebook in the cve_exposure directory to generate
the plots. It also provides detailed instructions for a scaled-down experiment
to compute CVE Exposure scores when compute resources are limited.

Before you begin, ensure the Python virtual environment is installed and
activated.

To open the Jupyter notebook:
```
$ cd cve_exposure
$ conda activate supply_chain_py311
$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=6868

# In the terminal output, click the access-token URL to open Jupyter in your browser.
```
To run on public infrastructure (Google Colab):
1. Upload the `cve_exposure/CVE_Exposure.ipynb` notebook on Google Colab
2. On the left pane of Google Colab, click on the option to upload more files
3. Upload the `cve_exposure/for_colab.zip` archive
4. Execute all cells sequentially to get the plots
5. Compare the plots with those in the `expected` directory
